1. What happens when you initialize a repository? 
By typing command git init git bash will create file called .git.
 
2. Why do you need to do it?


We tell the git to track all changes that is made by anyone in the directory where we initialize GIT. 

3. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

Staging area is place that helps to us to commit specific file changes. For example, 
if you have 20 files on you working directory and you made some changes on file 2 and file 5 and they are logically connected. 
By using git add command you can add to your repository this two files with one comments since they are logicalyy connected.  

4. What value do you think it offers?


It offers functionality to full control your project in any stage of changing. 

5. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
By using command git diff --staged i could know what i did and what changes i made sience last time when i added my changes to staging area. 

6. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? 
As Coroline said before you may add new expermental functions to your project. Which you are not sure does it work properly. In this case you can split your project branch to something called expermental. And any changes that you made in expermatal branch does not affect you main branch. 
How would branches help?

7.How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrms helps to users where started a new branch with it's commits and when they are merged with master branch. 


8. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
When you merge two branches all the changes made by both branches will be merged and commits that you did they will be reachable from master brach. We need diagram to know where does started new branch and it's parrent branch and sience than we created new branch.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
